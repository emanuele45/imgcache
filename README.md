##Image cache

###Introduction
When using HTTPS connections the browers usually do not show external images embedded with the img tag that link to HTTP urls because they breach the security of the page.

This addon, when necessary, fetches a preview of the image, stores it in the cache directory and shows it in place of the original image, along with a message (added through javascript) that instruct the members and visitors to click to see the image at it's original size.

It's a very basic implementation without any setting, more will come.
